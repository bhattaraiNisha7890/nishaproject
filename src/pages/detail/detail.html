	<p>A legal description of real property does not require that a street address be present. Since road names and addresses can change, a street address is often only used to outline a current homeâ€™s address. If an invalid address is present, it will need to be waived.

A survey will need to be done for a proper legal description to be formed. A real estate lawyer is the ideal professional that should be sought when you need a legal description to be written. Without a proper description, you, as the seller, may find that your sale was void due to an improper land description. </p>
